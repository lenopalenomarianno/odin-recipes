        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Although there's no rule against making candied yams any time you want, there are three times a year when candied yam recipes reach their peak popularity: Thanksgiving by far leads the way, with Christmas and Easter coming in a distant second and third.

            So, it's safe to say that if you're making candied yams, it's probably for a holiday feast. And with all the prep and cooking that goes into the holidays, it's no surprise that our Allrecipes home cooks appreciate an easy four-ingredient recipe like Candied Yams as a no-fuss side dish to round out their special holiday menus.
